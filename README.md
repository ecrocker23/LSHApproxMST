# LSHApproxMST

Supplement to the Senior Thesis titled "An Empirical Study of Locality-Sensitive Hashing to Approximate the Minimum Spanning Tree" by Elizabeth Crocker, advised by Professor Deeparnab Chakrabarty, in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Honors Program in Computer Science at Dartmouth College. Based on the algorithm by Har-Peled, Indyk, and Motwani in their paper titled "Approximate Near Neighbor:  Toward Removing the Curse of Dimensionality".

*LSHApproxMST_implementation.ipynb* contains the implementation of the algorithm, as well as three generation functions for simulated test data, an environment for testing simulated data as well as real data, and supplemental algorithm modifications.

*plants_data.csv* is data taken from the National Plant Data Center, http://plants.usda.gov, manipulated for testing purposes.
